# Icon Creation Process

The graduation hat icon is sourced freely from https://lucide.dev/ where the
corresponding license can be found in the `3RD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` file in the
root folder of this repository.

The graduation hat icon was then transformed into a full app icon using
https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/.
